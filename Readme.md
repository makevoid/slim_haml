# Slim example using MtHaml

Just a simple example using Slim with MtHaml

### Configuration

Slim needs apache .htaccess enabled (ex: AllowOverride All), for nginx search
google (slim nginx htaccess) :) 

### Install

You need to setup open read/write permissions to `tmp` directory:

    chmod -R a+rw tmp

### Features

- slim framework
- reads external haml and php templates (in /views)
- caches compiled haml templates for speed 


### foreword

You know what?
It has been very long time since I haven't touched php and after that... with 5.3, apart from some strangeness in the object model and syntax.. I kinda like it ^^ (dont tell anyone!)
